Rotary has a chance to capture the world’s attention and realize possibilities beyond our expectations. But we must build on the work that has come before us if we are to reach our goals, such as defeating polio and empowering girls and women. ",

It is brave to be vulnerable and to admit you don’t have all the answers. Reaching out for help is courageous – and continuing on a path towards wellness is even more so.",
